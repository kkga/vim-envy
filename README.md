# Envy

Light color scheme for Vim with comfortable contrast.
Intended for both day and night usage with moderate screen brightness and color temperature.

A "fake-busy" screenshot gives an idea of some highlights in action.
Colors are used sparingly and mostly for UI-related highlights (search, errors, etc...).

### Requirements

Use either `set termguicolors` or `set notermguicolors`: the color scheme should look practically the same, as all colors are from the [256 Xterm color palette](https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/).

16-color terminals probably work, but not tested. Colors for terminal emulators provided further below.
